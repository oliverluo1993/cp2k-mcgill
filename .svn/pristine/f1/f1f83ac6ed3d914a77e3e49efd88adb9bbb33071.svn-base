# runs are executed in the same order as in this file
# the second field tells which test should be run in order to compare with the last available output
# e.g. 0 means do not compare anything, running is enough
#      1 compares the last total energy in the file

# Compute the lowest 3 singlet excited states of a formaldehyde molecule at PBE0 / aug-TZV2P-GTH level of theory.
# As the output format will likely be changed in the near future, at the given stage simply ensure that the task is running
# Reference TDDFT excitation energies (in eV): 4.07, 6.72, 7.52
