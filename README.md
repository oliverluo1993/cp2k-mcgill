# cp2k developers at mcgill. branched from the official svn repository at r17181 (with minor ALMO EDA updates)

Purpose of creating this git repository is to keep track of numerous CP2K development projects at McGill.

Typical development cycle:

1. Master branch of this git repository is periodically syncronized with the trunk of the official svn repository.
2. All git branches receive updates from master git branch.
3. When the development in a git branch is finished this branch is merged into master git branch.
4. All new developments in master git branch are send to the official svn repository.
